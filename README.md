# LeetCode - Probelms and their Solutions 
Welcome to my Problem-Solving Repository, a comprehensive collection of solutions to a wide range of programming, data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming problems. This repository is designed to serve as a personal reference, learning resource, and contribution to the coding community.

The primary goal of this repository is to systematically solve problems from various online judges, coding platforms, and contests, while also keeping track of the corresponding problem links for easy reference. Each problem solution is carefully written with clarity, efficiency, and best coding practices in mind, making it easier for anyone to understand the approach and logic behind the solution.

Key Features:

Structured Organization: Problems are categorized by topics such as arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and more, making navigation straightforward.

Problem Links: Every solution is accompanied by a link to the original problem, enabling users to attempt the problem themselves before checking the solution.

Multiple Programming Languages: While most solutions are in [specify your primary language, e.g., Python/C++/Java], some problems may have implementations in multiple languages to provide different perspectives.

Learning Resource: Along with working solutions, some files include detailed explanations, step-by-step approaches, and insights into optimization techniques, making it a great learning resource for beginners and advanced programmers alike.

Continuous Updates: This repository is actively maintained, with new problems added regularly as I continue solving and improving my coding skills.

Whether you are preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming contests, or just want to enhance your problem-solving skills, this repository can serve as a valuable resource to learn from practical examples and tested solutions.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute! Constructive feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Together, we can build a comprehensive library of problem-solving knowledge.
